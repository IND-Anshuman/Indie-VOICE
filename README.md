# Indie-VOICES: Multilingual Audio Generation for Indian Languages üáÆüá≥

**Indie-VOICES** is a multilingual **text-to-speech (TTS)** system designed to generate expressive, human-like voices across 22+ major Indian languages.  
It combines **Indic-Parler-TTS** for speech synthesis with **Google Gemini** for context-aware, expressive voice tone generation ‚Äî enabling dynamic, natural-sounding output suitable for podcasts, assistants, lectures, and more.

---

## üåê Overview

This project integrates **Gemini LLM** (for intelligent voice characterization) and **Indic-Parler-TTS** (for multi-lingual audio synthesis).  
It‚Äôs built to handle long-form inputs by chunking text, generating expressive tone descriptions, and synthesizing seamless voice audio batches.

### Key Features

- üîπ Supports 22+ Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, Malayalam, etc.)  
- üîπ Integrates **Gemini LLM** to expand short voice cues into expressive, natural tone prompts  
- üîπ Deterministic decoding for stable, reproducible results  
- üîπ Batch-based long-text generation with silence merging between segments  
- üîπ RMS normalization and anti-clipping for studio-quality output  
- üîπ Built-in text preprocessing for sentence-balanced chunking

## üß© System Architecture


### 1. **Gemini Voice Description Generator**
- Takes a short cue like *"friendly Hindi female teacher"*  
- Uses Gemini to expand it into a detailed tone prompt specifying emotion, pitch, pace, etc.  
- This description conditions the TTS model for expressive output.

### 2. **Indic-Parler-TTS Synthesis Engine**
- Tokenizes both **voice descriptor** and **text input**  
- Processes text in batches using deterministic decoding (no random sampling)  
- Normalizes and merges generated audio chunks into a single `.wav` file

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

Clone the repository and set up dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Indie-VOICES.git
cd Indie-VOICES
pip install -r requirements.txt


**Recommended Python version:** 3.9+  
**Supported OS:** Linux / Windows / macOS  
**GPU:** Optional (CUDA-supported GPU for faster synthesis)

## üîê Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file for your API keys.  
Use `.env.example` as a template and rename it:


---

### üöÄ Setting Up Authentication

#### 1. **Gemini API Key**
Get your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).  
Once you have it, set it in your terminal or `.env` file:


#### 2. **Hugging Face Authentication**

Login to Hugging Face using your access token to enable model downloads:
In terminal write : hf auth login

When prompted, paste your **Hugging Face token** from  
[https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

## üß† How It Works

### Step 1: Initialization  
The class `IndicTTSLLM` initializes:
- Gemini client for natural tone expansion  
- Parler-TTS model and tokenizer (CPU/GPU auto-detection)  

### Step 2: Voice Cue Interpretation  
`generate_voice_description()` sends the cue to Gemini and returns a refined professional-style voice prompt.  
Example input:  
> ‚Äúenergetic Hindi female teacher voice‚Äù  
Output:  
> ‚ÄúEnergetic and expressive Hindi female educator voice with natural intonation, moderate pace, and confident projection.‚Äù

### Step 3: Text Processing  
Text is split using regex into balanced, sentence-sized segments for smoother generation.

### Step 4: Audio Generation  
For each text batch:
- Tokens are prepared for description and text  
- Parler-TTS generates batch-wise audio  
- Normalization and anti-clipping applied  
- All batches merged with 150ms natural silence  

### Step 5: Saving Output  
Final speech combined and saved to WAV format at a specified path (e.g., `output.wav`).

## üß™ Example Usage
from indie_voices import IndicTTSLLM

tts = IndicTTSLLM(batch_size=2)

text = """‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç, ‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§π‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á..."""

voice_style = """Generate a clear, engaging male Hindi teacher voice for an educational lecture.
Tone: informative, calm, confident. Speaking pace: moderate. Language: Hindi."""

tts.synthesize(text, voice_style, "lecture_output.wav")
